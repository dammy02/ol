<h3>facts about guardian</h3>

<li>The word Pangolin comes from ‘penggulung,’ the Malay word for roller – the action a pangolin takes in self-defense. A startled pangolin will cover its head with its front legs, exposing its scales to any potential predator. If touched or grabbed it will roll up completely into a ball, while the sharp scales on the tail can be used to lash out</li>
<li>All eight pan   golin species are protected under national and international laws, and two are listed as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.</li>
<li>In China and Vietnam, pangolins are highly prized by consumers for their meat and their unique scales. While they are a potent defence against predators, their scales are useless against poachers, and all eight species in Asia and Africa are now under threat. Over the past decade, over a million pangolins have been illegally taken from the wild to feed demand in China and Vietnam. Their meat is considered a delicacy, while their scales are used in traditional Chinese medicine as they are believed to treat a range of ailments from asthma to rheumatism and arthritis.</li>
<li>Despite their threatened status, there is good news for pangolins. The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) recently voted to end international commercial trade in all pangolins through listing the eight species in Appendix I of the Convention, a ruling that will come into force early this year. However, the illegal widlife trade is still a threat to pangolins. You can help protect them by reporting wildlife crime.</li>
